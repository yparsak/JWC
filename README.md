# JWC
Java Web Client - Menu Program

A java web client program that manages users and their roles, and displays menu items. The intention of this project is to 
communicate with a back-end system and display reports and allow users to edit/update forms.

Once deployed, the admin should type /JWC/setup to create ADMIN user, then login as admin user, to add more users, and setup
departments, and roles, and assign users to their department and roles. The admin will also be able to add menu and submenu items,
and define api.

See api_test for sample (get method) API call.
